# NLP-Based-Healthcare-Data-Cleansing-and-Classification-Report

Description:

This project utilizes machine learning models (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) to predict healthcare diagnoses based on patient data. Deployed on IBM Cloud, the application features a user-friendly interface for easy interaction. Users can upload CSV datasets for analysis and receive diagnostic predictions. The models demonstrated strong performance, achieving an overall accuracy of approximately 84% (Random Forest) and 83% (Logistic Regression). Notably, "Hypertension" was predicted with high accuracy, while "Myocardial Infarction" showed areas for potential improvement. This project aims to provide a scalable and accessible tool for timely and accurate healthcare predictions.

Key Features:

Machine Learning Models: Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
IBM Cloud Deployment: Scalable and secure deployment.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy interaction for users.
CSV Upload: Analyze custom datasets.
Performance Metrics: Detailed classification reports and model comparison.
Potential Improvements (Future Scope):

Deployment of the UI on Vercel for improved accessibility.
Database integration for data storage and analysis.
Automated report generation with performance metrics.
Model enhancements to improve accuracy, particularly for "Myocardial Infarction."

How to Use:
1. download the HTML and Server.py file
2. download the libraries
3. run the html file on specified server
4. provide your data and get the classification results.
